        <p>I am the Game Design Architect for 
        <a href = "https://www.silenthgames.com/"> Silent H Games.</a> Our first game is Don't Spill My Tea,
            a fun-filled card game featuring cute teapots, teacups, teabags, bonus point sweeteners and many cards
            to fill your teapots and mess with your opponents. I have made a digitized version of the game using Python. Here is a screenshot of the digitized
            version using Python:
