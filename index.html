        <p>Hi! I am Hannah. I am currently an Assistant Adjunct Professor in mathematics at UCLA working 
        on calculating the essential p-dimension of finite simple groups under the mentorship of 
        Alexander Merkurjev.  I am the Game Design Architect for 
        <a href = "https://www.silenthgames.com/"> Silent H Games,</a> 
        a game company that I co-founded with the talented artist, Kara Thibault. 
        I also play the harp, and I double majored in math and harp at the University of Arizona. 
        I love the outdoors; hiking, biking, rollerblading, and snowboarding are some of my favorite
        activities. I also enjoy learning languages, playing board games, and learning various programming languages.</p>
